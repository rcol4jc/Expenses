# Ranch Expenses
year for tax purposes. 
A simple Expenses App that I made for my Father-in-Law. He needed a program to keep track of his expenses for his ranch and create a print out at beginning of the next year for his tax man

##Languages

3. javascript

##Design

###MVC

The foundation of this project was a simple open-source MVC framework created by Brad Traversy and taught in his course on Udemy
[https://www.udemy.com/object-oriented-php-mvc/](https://www.udemy.com/object-oriented-php-mvc/). This really helped me wrap my mind
around the MVC design principles as I built this.

###Visual Design

My father-in-law is a 60+ year-old-man who will not let go of his flip phone and calls Facebook "Spacebook". Therefore a very simple design was absolutely necessary.  

##Programming Philosophy

This program has the following objects:

1. Expense headings or types such as Cattle feed, Randy house. 
2. Expense Entries-These are the products and services purchased for the ranch. Required info is Date, Expense type (dropdown), and amount. There is also an optional Note fied.
