# Ranch Expenses

This is a simple Expenses App that I made for my Father-in-Law. He needed a program to keep track of his expenses for his ranch and create a print out at beginning of the next year for his tax man

## Languages

1. PHP
2. CSS (yes, not a language, but easier this way)
3. javascript

## Frameworks and/or Libraries

1. MVC (See below)
2. Bootstrap
3. jQuery

## Design

### MVC

The foundation of this project was a simple open-source MVC framework created by Brad Traversy and taught in his course on Udemy
[https://www.udemy.com/object-oriented-php-mvc/](https://www.udemy.com/object-oriented-php-mvc/). This really helped me wrap my mind
around the MVC design principles as I built this.

### Visual Design

My father-in-law is a 60+ year-old-man who will not let go of his flip phone and calls Facebook "Spacebook". Therefore a very simple design was absolutely necessary.  

## Objects

This program has the following objects:

1. Expense headings or types such as Cattle feed, Randy house. 
2. Expense Entries-These are the products and services purchased for the ranch. Required info is Date, Expense type (dropdown), and amount. There is also an optional Note fied.

## Programming Philosophy

First, I am using the KISS principle (Keep it simple stupid). Note, I tried to make a balance between simple for the user and as simple as possible for a programner. I made sure to comment extensively.

Second, I tried use Object Oriented PHP and dependensy injection. There is probably easier ways to program, but I tried to eliminate any way that my father-in-law could destroy anything and the best way to start is encapsilation. 

## Have a crack at it!

Feel free to clone it and play around with it! That's how we all learn!
